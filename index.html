          <p class="h-sub">
            I’m a Computing student at West Suffolk College with an ICT qualification and a Level 3 Computing qualification.
            I’m working towards a career in IT — with a focus on cyber security — and I enjoy hardware-based projects as well
            as building creative coursework solutions.
